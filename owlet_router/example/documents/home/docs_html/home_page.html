<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sonnts996/owlet-router/tree/refactor/owlet_router">owlet_router</a> is a route
manager. It utilizes the route builder to
construct the router.</p>
<p>It is designed with several purposes in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a clear and easily definable route manager that is simple to read and use.</li>
<li>Built upon the base Flutter Router, allowing for integration with various page route types and the
ability to customize and extend the router.</li>
<li>Enabling modularization of the router, making it easy to segment routes and create independent
routes.</li>
<li>Offering the capability to check, prevent, or redirect routes before they are pushed.</li>
</ul>
