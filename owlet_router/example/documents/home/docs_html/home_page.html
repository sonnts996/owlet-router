<h1>Owlet Router Example</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sonnts996/owlet-router/tree/refactor/owlet_router">owlet_router</a> is a route
manager. It utilizes the route builder to
construct the router.</p>
<p>It is designed with several purposes in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a clear and easily definable route manager that is simple to read and use.</li>
<li>Built upon the base Flutter Router, allowing for integration with various page route types and the
ability to customize and extend the router.</li>
<li>Enabling modularization of the router, making it easy to segment routes and create independent
routes.</li>
<li>Offering the capability to check, prevent, or redirect routes before they are pushed.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Project structure</h1>
<pre><code>// Main NavigationService	
MainRoute 					 
  │ // home page with a nested navigator
  ├── home ('/home') 		 
  │ │
  │ │ // nested route is '/home/'
  │ ├── homePage ('/') 		
  │ │
  │ │ // nested route is '/home/t/* 
  │ └── tabPage ('/t/*') 
  │ 
  ├── profile ('/profile')
  └── splash ('/')
</code></pre>
<p>This example app showcases a &quot;MainRoute&quot; module with three pages: Home, Profile, and a Splash Page.
The Home page leverages a nested service, commonly used for nested navigation. When you navigate to
a route starting with &quot;/home&quot;, the app checks if the Home page is already open. If not, it opens it.
Otherwise, it sends a notification to the open Home page, prompting it to update its &quot;TabPage&quot; and
scroll to the relevant content. This demonstrates dynamic page updates based on routing actions,
avoiding unnecessary page creation.</p>

<p>[!Heads up!]</p>
<p>The Owlet Router details within this example app might be a bit out-of-date. It's always a good
idea to refer to the latest
official <a href="https://github.com/sonnts996/owlet-router/tree/main/owlet_router">documentation</a> for the
most accurate information.</p>
