The `owlet_router` is a route manager, not a route itself. It utilizes the route builder to
construct the router.

It is designed with several purposes in mind:

- Providing a clear and easily definable route manager that is simple to read and use.
- Built upon the base Flutter Router, allowing for integration with various page route types and the
  ability to customize and extend the router.
- Enabling modularization of the router, making it easy to segment routes and create independent
  routes.
- Offering the capability to check, prevent, or redirect routes before they are pushed.
