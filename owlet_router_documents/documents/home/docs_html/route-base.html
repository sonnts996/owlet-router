<h2>5.1. Route builder</h2>
<p>Think of <code>RouteBase</code> as a folder; it doesn't create anything, making it a non-launchable route. To
create a page route, we use <code>RouteBuilder</code>, which is a launchable route.</p>
<pre><code class="language-dart">final page1 = RouteBuilder(
  '/page1',
  builder: (settings) =&gt;
      MaterialPageRoute(
        settings: settings,
        builder: (context) =&gt; Page1(arguments: settings.arguments),
      ),
);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>RouteBuilder</code> allows you to customize your <code>PageRoute</code>, and we have created
some <a href="#53-custom-routebuilder">custom</a> <code>RouteBuilder</code>. You can also customize your <code>PageRoute</code> by
overriding the <code>RouteBuilder.builder</code> method.</p>
