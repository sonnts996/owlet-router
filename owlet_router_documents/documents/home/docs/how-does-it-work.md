## 5.2. How does it work?

1. What is the route path?

   To obtain the path of the `splash`, you can use the `splash.path` method. The `splash` path is
   generated by concatenating its parent path with its own path. If the result contains duplicate
   slashes (`//`), they will be merged into one. Therefore, if you wish for the segment to have the
   same route as its parent, simply use a single slash (`/`) as its segment.

2. Push a new route

   If you know the path, a simplified approach is to use `Navigator.pushNamed` to push it onto the
   Navigator.

    ```dart
    Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/home');
 
    // or
 
    Navigator.of(context).pushNamed(appRoute.home.path);
    ```

   The `RouteBuilder`'s extension provides an other method to push it

   ```dart
   appRoute.home.pushNamed(context);
   ```

3. Argument and result

   The RouteBuilder<A, T>.pushNamed method provides information about the route's argument type
   and result type

    ```dart
    final page2 = RouteBuilder<String, bool>(
     '/page2',
     builder: (settings) {
       final greeting = settings.arguments as String?;
       return MaterialPageRoute(
         builder: (context) => TestApp(content: greeting),
       );
     },
    );
    
    // ...
    final bool result = await page2.pushName(context, args: /* String type is required*/);
    ```

4. In a module:

   If `ListItemRoute` is located within a module package, you cannot access the `appRoute` because
   it is
   defined in the main package. Instead, you can use `RouteBase.of<ListItemRoute>()` to specifically
   retrieve your items route. This approach promotes greater independence of your code between
   different packages.
